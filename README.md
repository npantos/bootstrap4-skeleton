# bootstrap4-skeleton

1. `npm install` - this will install all dependencies
    
2. `gulp` - run this only once if you want to change source files. Everytime you start this, it will clean src and js/css folders, and it will minify all styles and scripts.

3. `gulp watch` - run this for live browser changes
